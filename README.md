# A wrapper project for GLWF and GLAD
This project was made to help with my graphic project I'm currently doing for my school
It makes so I don't have to rewrite the code for textures, shaders, window managment, etc...  
stb_image is used for image file loading in the textures.

**Currently this is still a wrapper project in the making and will be expended in the future**
## Current project I own that use this wrapper
